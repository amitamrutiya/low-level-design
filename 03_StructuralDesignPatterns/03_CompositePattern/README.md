# Composite Pattern

## Definition
The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Key Points
- Creates a tree structure of objects
- Clients can treat composite and individual objects uniformly
- Represents part-whole hierarchies
- Follows object-oriented principle of recursion

## Example Implementation
The example shows a file system structure implementation:
- `FileSystemComponent`: Common interface
- `File`: Leaf node
- `Directory`: Composite node
- Both implement common operations like size(), display()

## Class Diagram
```
+------------------+
| FileSystemComponent|
+------------------+
| +display()       |
| +size()         |
+------------------+
         â–²
         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
+-------+ +---------+
| File  | |Directory|
+-------+ +---------+
         | children |
         +---------+
```

## Benefits
1. Simplifies client code
2. Makes it easier to add new types of components
3. Provides flexibility in building tree structures
4. Creates a uniform interface for all objects

## Cons/Challenges
1. Can make design overly general
2. Might be difficult to restrict components
3. Can be hard to maintain type safety
4. May need careful handling of operations that don't make sense for all components
