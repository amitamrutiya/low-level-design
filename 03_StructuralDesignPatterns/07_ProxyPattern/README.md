# Proxy Pattern

## Definition
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It creates a representative object that controls access to another object, which may be remote, expensive to create, or in need of securing.

## Key Points
- Controls access to another object
- Same interface as the real object
- Can add functionality without changing real object
- Types: Virtual, Protection, Remote, Smart Reference

## Example Implementation
The example shows an image loading system:
- `Image`: Common interface
- `RealImage`: Actual image object
- `ImageProxy`: Proxy that controls image loading
- Lazy loading of actual image

## Benefits
1. Controls access to original object
2. Supports lazy initialization
3. Implements logging and access control
4. Separates concerns from main functionality

## Cons/Challenges
1. Adds another layer of abstraction
2. Can make the code more complex
3. May impact performance
4. Response might be delayed
