# Bridge Pattern

## Definition
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It involves creating a bridge interface that uses composition instead of inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.

## Key Points
- Separates abstraction from implementation
- Uses composition over inheritance
- Enables independent variation of abstraction and implementation
- Promotes loose coupling

## Example Implementation
The example demonstrates a remote control system for different types of devices:
- `Device`: Implementation interface
- `RemoteControl`: Abstraction
- `TV`, `Radio`: Concrete implementations
- `BasicRemote`, `AdvancedRemote`: Refined abstractions

## Class Diagram
```
+-------------+        +-------------+
| RemoteControl|<>---->|   Device    |
+-------------+        +-------------+
| -device     |        | +turnOn()   |
| +turnOn()   |        | +turnOff()  |
| +turnOff()  |        | +setChannel()|
+-------------+        +-------------+
      ▲                      ▲
      |                      |
+----------------+    +-----------+
|AdvancedRemote  |    |    TV     |
+----------------+    +-----------+
```

## Benefits
1. Strong separation of concerns
2. Enhanced extensibility
3. Hides implementation details from clients
4. Follows Single Responsibility and Open/Closed principles

## Cons/Challenges
1. Increased complexity for simple scenarios
2. Might be overkill for small applications
3. Need to plan the abstraction hierarchy carefully
4. Can be difficult to understand initially
