# Food Delivery System Design

This document explains the detailed design of a Food Delivery System, following SOLID principles and best practices in object-oriented design.

## System Components

### 1. User Management
- **User**: Abstract base class for all users in the system
- **Customer**: Handles customer-specific operations like placing orders and cart management
- **DeliveryPartner**: Manages delivery-related operations and status
- **Restaurant**: Represents restaurant entities with menu and order management

### 2. Order Management
- **Order**: Central entity managing the entire order lifecycle
- **OrderItem**: Represents individual items in an order with customizations
- **MenuItem**: Detailed representation of items available in restaurant menus

### 3. Payment System
- **Payment**: Manages payment processing and status
- **PaymentMethod**: Interface for different payment methods
- **CreditCardPayment/UPIPayment**: Concrete implementations of payment methods

### 4. Delivery Management
- **DeliveryInfo**: Tracks delivery status and location
- **Location**: Handles geographical coordinates and distance calculations

### 5. Rating & Review System
- **Review**: Manages customer feedback for restaurants and delivery partners

### 6. Search & Filtering
- **SearchService**: Handles restaurant search and filtering operations

### 7. Notification System
- **NotificationService**: Interface for different types of notifications
- **Email/SMS/PushNotification**: Concrete implementations for different notification channels

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Examples:
  - `Order` handles order-related operations
  - `Payment` focuses only on payment processing
  - `DeliveryInfo` manages delivery-specific information

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- System is open for extension but closed for modification
- Examples:
  - `PaymentMethod` interface allows adding new payment methods without changing existing code
  - `NotificationService` interface enables adding new notification types

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Inheritance hierarchies are designed for proper substitution
- Examples:
  - `Customer` and `DeliveryPartner` can be used wherever `User` is expected
  - All payment methods can be used interchangeably through `PaymentMethod` interface

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Interfaces are specific to client needs
- Examples:
  - `NotificationService` has a single method for sending notifications
  - `PaymentMethod` interface includes only payment-related methods

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Examples:
  - Order system depends on `PaymentMethod` interface rather than concrete implementations
  - Notification system depends on `NotificationService` interface

## Key Features

1. **Order Management**
   - Place, track, and manage orders
   - Real-time order status updates
   - Order history and details

2. **Restaurant Operations**
   - Menu management
   - Order processing
   - Availability updates

3. **Delivery System**
   - Real-time location tracking
   - ETA calculations
   - Delivery partner assignment

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Multiple payment methods
   - Secure transaction handling
   - Refund processing

5. **User Experience**
   - Search and filtering
   - Reviews and ratings
   - Multi-channel notifications

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Modular Design**
   - Independent components
   - Easy to extend and modify
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Performance**
   - Location-based operations optimization
   - Efficient search and filtering
   - Asynchronous notification handling

3. **Reliability**
   - Payment processing safety
   - Order tracking accuracy
   - Delivery system reliability
