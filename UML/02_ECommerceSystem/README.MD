# E-commerce System Design - UML Class Diagram

## System Overview
This document presents a comprehensive UML class diagram for an E-commerce system designed following SOLID principles. The system is modularized into several key components that handle different aspects of the e-commerce operations.

## Core Components

### 1. User Management
- **User (Abstract Class)**
  - Base class for all user types
  - Handles common user attributes and operations
- **Customer**
  - Manages customer-specific operations
  - Shopping cart management
  - Order history
- **Admin**
  - Product management
  - User management
  - Order management

### 2. Product Management
- **Product**
  - Core product information
  - Inventory management
  - Pricing details
- **Category**
  - Product categorization
  - Hierarchical category structure
- **Inventory**
  - Stock management
  - Low stock alerts

### 3. Order Management
- **Order**
  - Order processing
  - Order status tracking
  - Payment integration
- **OrderItem**
  - Individual items in an order
  - Quantity management
- **ShoppingCart**
  - Temporary storage for items
  - Price calculation

### 4. Payment System
- **Payment (Interface)**
  - Abstract payment operations
- **CreditCardPayment**
  - Credit card processing
- **DebitCardPayment**
  - Debit card processing
- **DigitalWallet**
  - Digital wallet integration

### 5. Shipping
- **Shipping (Interface)**
  - Shipping method abstraction
- **StandardShipping**
  - Regular shipping options
- **ExpressShipping**
  - Premium shipping options
- **Address**
  - Delivery location management

### 6. Review & Rating
- **Review**
  - Product reviews
  - Rating system
- **Rating**
  - Numerical rating
  - Rating analytics

## SOLID Principles Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class has one specific responsibility
   - Separate classes for User, Order, Product management

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Payment and Shipping interfaces allow easy extension
   - New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Customer and Admin properly extend User class
   - All payment methods correctly implement Payment interface

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Separate interfaces for Payment and Shipping
   - Specific interfaces for different user roles

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions
   - Order processing depends on Payment interface, not concrete implementations

## Relationships

### Associations
- Customer has one ShoppingCart
- Order contains multiple OrderItems
- Product belongs to one or more Categories
- User can have multiple Orders

### Aggregations
- ShoppingCart aggregates OrderItems
- Category can have multiple Products

### Compositions
- Order is composed of OrderItems
- User owns Address information

### Inheritance
- Customer and Admin inherit from User
- Different Payment methods inherit from Payment interface
- Shipping methods implement Shipping interface

## Note
This UML class diagram represents a comprehensive E-commerce system that follows SOLID principles and best practices in object-oriented design. The system is modular, extensible, and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined relationships between components.
